AKINBLOG 1.0 by Akintunde Jegede

This is a simple portfolio+ blog script that is powered by PHP And MYSQL

It has built-in blog system and admin section.

This script was built with a beauty and minimalism in mind both in concept and in design.

There is an sql dump file for the script that you can use to run your blog section.


The Admin section that gives you access to the blog has a default username: Admin and password: 123456

So feel free to use this script and don't forget to read the license which basically allows you to do anything with the script except that you always mention me as a contributor and that if you made any gains, money or otherwise, feel free to appreciate me according to your own discretion.
