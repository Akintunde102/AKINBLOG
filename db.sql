First, it is an issue of irresponsibility; this year we have spent about one trillion and given the state of the finances, we have to save money from every means.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince the eventual removal of fuel subsidy problems and challenges, the Petroleum Price Modulation has been assumed as a panacea for all forms of fuel subsidy ,even though the GMD of NNPC, Dr. Kachikwu responded to say that the price modulation had nothing to do with the removal or existence of subsidy.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong><u>How does Petroleum Price Subsidy help the problem of fuel subsidy?</u></strong><br />\r\nIn my own opinion, the Petroleum Price Modulation has not helped in alleviating the problems of petroleum subsidy in any form whatsoever, rather it has been defeated by the unfair oligopolistic sabotage of the Petroleum Price Subsidy by Nigerian &nbsp;petroleum marketers through exorbitant price fixing and unchecked hoarding of petroleum products to frustrate supply and increase demand, and thus price.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis price fixing ranges from about <s>N</s>100 to <s>N</s>180 which is roughly <s>N</s>20 to <s>N</s>90 above the expected pump price.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore so, as at the time of announcement of the Petroleum Price Modulation mechanism, the price band was stated at a lower limit of <s>N</s>87 per litre to an upper limit of <s>N</s>90 per litre.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNevertheless, the pump price have gone almost 100% above this &nbsp;limit at most PMS retail outlets, except in NNPC Petrol Stations &nbsp;and Petrol stations in Major Cities which are considerably fewer than the Independently Owned Retail outlets in 35 other cities apart from Lagos and Abuja.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to the SB MORGEN INTELLIGENCE case study, there is also a possibility of the economics (behind the pricing template utilized by the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency-PPPRA) being divorced from economic realities on ground, as often happens in the Nigerian officialdom. This means that the pricing template being followed by the PPPRA might not be realistic for use by the marketers.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nBelow are figures showing the result of the SB MORGEN INTELLIGENCE case study on prices at different retail outlets across the country\r\n<div style="text-align:center">\r\n<figure class="image" style="display:inline-block"><img alt="" height="549" src="http://localhost/akincom/images/PriceModulation.jpg" width="413" />\r\n<figcaption>Figure 1.0: &nbsp;A TABULAR REPRESENTATION OF DIFFERENT PUMP PRICE VARIATION IN DIFFERENT ZONES IN THE COUNTRY</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div style="text-align:center">\r\n<figure class="image" style="display:inline-block"><img alt="" height="518" src="http://localhost/akincom/images/subsee.jpg" width="559" />\r\n<figcaption>Figure 2.0: A COLOUR MAP SHOWING MEAN FUEL PRICE PAID ABOVE UNSUBSIDIED PETROL PRICE IN SELECTED STATES (IN NAIRA).&nbsp;</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nReferences:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A Commentary on the Modulation of the Prices of Petroleum Products in Nigeria (2016, March 28) .

(12, 'Will Smith Biography', 'Will Smith''s Biography', '<p><strong>Will Smith</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Willard Christopher Smith II (born September 25, 1968) is an African American actor and rapper. He is one of few people who has enjoyed success in the three major entertainment media in the United States: film, television, and the music industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Biography</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith was born and raised in the Wynnefield section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the second of four children. He often uses the line &quot;West Philadelphia born and raised&quot; to describe his roots. He is a graduate of Overbrook High School. He was admitted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but chose to pursue acting instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Will Smith started his career as The Fresh Prince, the vocalist of the hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince, which included childhood friend Jeffrey &quot;DJ Jazzy Jeff&quot; Townes as turntablist and producer. The duo was known for performing humorous, radio-friendly songs, most notably &quot;Parents Just Don&#39;t Understand&quot; and &quot;Summertime&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith was a charismatic and energetic performer, and in 1990, the NBC television network signed him up and built a sitcom, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, around him. The show was successful and ran for six seasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although he made a notable dramatic film debut in Six Degrees of Separation (in which he played totally against type as a gay con man) while still appearing in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Smith&#39;s film career took off with his role in Bad Boys (1995) along with co-star Martin Lawrence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air came to an end in 1996, Smith began a successful solo career in music and simultaneously starred in a series of films. The first two films were hugely successful summer blockbusters: Independence Day (1996), where he plays a fearless and confident fighter pilot, and Men in Black (1997), where he plays the comic and confident Agent J against Tommy Lee Jones&#39;s deadpan Agent K. Smith&#39;s acting in Men in Black won critical praise, and both films established Smith&#39;s commercial reputation as a &quot;bankable&quot; star who had appeal across age, race, and gender, and could &quot;open&quot; a film at the box office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lead roles in Enemy of the State, Wild Wild West, Ali, Bad Boys II and I, Robot then followed. His most recent film is 2005&#39;s Hitch. (Like Smith, Hitch co-star Kevin James starred in a sitcom named for royalty, The King of Queens.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of the boxer Muhammad Ali in Ali.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith also released a string of hit singles, often associated with his most recent film, throughout the late 1990s. The most notable of these were his #1 hit theme song &quot;Men in Black&quot;, the #1 hit &quot;Gettin&#39; Jiggy Wit It&quot; (which made jiggy a catchphrase for a while in 1998), and &quot;Just the Two of Us&quot;, an affecting message to his young son. His first two solo albums went platinum, but his third, on Columbia Records, was a sales disappointment compared to his past efforts, and after a quick Greatest Hits release that was almost not advertised at all, he was dropped by the label. He signed a recording contract with Interscope Records and released the so far, moderately successful Lost and Found in 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On July 2, 2005, Smith served as host for the Live 8 concert in his native Philadelphia before an enormous crowd, and later performed a set with DJ Jazzy Jeff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith married actress Sharee Zampino in 1992. They had a son, Willard Christopher III, also known as &quot;Trey&quot;. They divorced in 1995. Smith married actress Jada Pinkett in 1997. They have had two children: Jaden Christopher Syre (1998) and Willow Camille Reign (2000). Along with his brother Harry Smith, he owns Treyball Development Inc., a Beverly Hills-based company named after his first son. With all his commercial success, Will Smith is arguably the biggest star in today&#39;s pop culture and his wealth has continued to grow as his name has continued to appear in Forbes Richest 40 under the age of 40.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Discography</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Albums</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>with DJ Jazzy Jeff (as The Fresh Prince)<br />\r\nRock the House (1987) #83 US<br />\r\nHe&#39;s the DJ, I&#39;m the Rapper (1988) #4 US<br />\r\nAnd in this Corner...

(14, 'The Internet: Its Opportunities and Wealth', 'What lies As advantages for Internet Users', '<br />\r\nI was 9 years old, bored, home alone and too lazy to read my school books. So I opened the dictionary like I always do at bored moment to check for new words. I skipped through my dad&#39;s big Dictionary, saw some of my best words, muttered them to myself and admired my rather weak knowledge of words.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEager to find a new one, I opened the pages further until I got to &quot;E&quot;, then I found a word: Spanish in origin this time around: &quot;Eldorado&quot;, so it was. Exquisite! It felt like the name of a street in Dubai (God knows why), I loved it, maybe because it bore a resemblance to the name of one of my favourite movies: &quot;Desperado&quot;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThen, I checked the meaning and if I clearly remember, it read thus:<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div style="background:#eee;border:1px solid #ccc;padding:5px 10px;">&quot;An imaginary&nbsp;place of great wealth and opportunity; sought in South&nbsp;America by 16th-century explorers&quot;.</div>\r\n<br />\r\nSince then, the word and its meaning has stayed glued to me as I couldn&#39;t just forget it and yet couldn&#39;t derive any use for it until many years after when I saw the internet in her fullness. Then, that was when the word&#39;s meaning took a real shape and thus, helped me coin my own definition of the internet:<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div style="background:#eee;border:1px solid #ccc;padding:5px 10px;">&quot;An imaginary&nbsp;place of great wealth and opportunity; sought everywhere by all for more&rdquo;</div>\r\n<br />\r\nThe internet is just a network of computers connected via Internet Protocol Suite for the fundamental purpose of information exchange and retrieval but it has gone beyond that. Far Beyond!! How? I&#39;ll explain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor some time now, I&#39;ve been unconsciously preaching about the Internet as though it was Noah&#39;s ark and the flood was coming, telling people about the advantages, opportunities and wealth that lie within the largely very much uncultivated virgin lands of the web. The internet, as I mentioned, is a &quot;largely uncultivated&hellip; land&quot; that will serve not just as an ark but as the final place of partial or full residence of services, business and Information. It&#39;s going to become the &quot;everything&quot; without which nothing can valuably become something. It will be so engrained into our existence that a day-absence will feel worse than a 7-day fast. That will be the lot of those of who will rather stay uninformed about the internet. I plead guilty to rude effrontery but not falsehood. And I do wish that you heed as you read.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe internet, its opportunities and wealth can be further explained as follows:\r\n<h1><br /><strong>1) &nbsp;The future:</strong></h1>\r\n<br />\r\nThe internet is the present and future, don&rsquo;t argue that! It has a lot in stock for the future and if you must know, many of the internet services you use are habit-intended products built majorly to create an addictive persona in you. And that is the more reason it usually comes as free in the first instance and then, you start getting charged when it&rsquo;s obvious you can no longer do without it. Thus, in the long run, there is a high possibility that many things will have to move over to the internet.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis in itself, needs to be reacted to, beforehand by businessmen and investors as the business men needs to start building its business plans with the internet in mind as an important medium of marketing, communication and product testing while the investor, on the other hand, should look out for opportunities and entrepreneurial pursuits that border along the line of Intelligent Internet Use. Also, the end users should try to be fairly literate in the way the internet operates.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe internet&#39;s future seems visible as it&#39;s already influencing so much in the present. As a member of the youth demographic, I see my friends buy more from the internet this days than they do from &quot;Offline&quot; shops, Why? &nbsp;There is room for Variety, Affordability and No Distance limitation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou could easily order goods from China, pay with your ATM and get the goods delivered in days, at worse, a week. Also you have unlimited array of goods to pick from, thus making things online quite cheaper .\r\n<h1><br />\r\n<strong>2) Communication:</strong></h1>\r\n<br />\r\nRecently, there was a complaints on the side of the Telecommunication Companies on how internet products which runs on their Internet Services are &quot;stealing&quot; their mobile services and products from them. They do not have a legal backing as it seems and so can only do best by re-strategizing and competing more intelligently.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat do I mean? Let&#39;s take an instance, before the popularity of the internet, most people make calls and send text messages directly from their phone through their service provider be it MTN, ETISALAT, AIRTEL and many other service product that are defunct but now, the reverse is the case, as many now prefer to make Whatsapp Calls, send WhatsApp Messages and chat on Facebook only at the more affordable expense of Mobile Data. Who wouldn&rsquo;t prefer that?\r\n<h1><br />\r\n<strong>3) Business and Work:</strong></h1>\r\n<br />\r\nThis is very important as everybody seems to be engaged in one business or another while are employed likewise, in such businesses. The influence of the internet on business and service provision seems to be silent, yet growing exponentially.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nToday, many companies involved in selling of goods have taken on the reins of Full Internet Integration to better expand their customer base, in ways they never thought possible before. More so, in advanced countries and even in some developing countries like ours, it has become relatively easy compared to the pre-internet days to easily employ and engage staffs without actually seeing them while solely depending on emails and e-messaging to relate and pass information. If you think this can&rsquo;t work, I will tell you :it worked, it is working and will continue to work better.<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h1><strong>4)</strong> <strong>Education:</strong></h1>\r\n<br />\r\nI will like to state my own homebred classification of education: Academic and Non Academic Education.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nNon-academic education covers knowledge and skill acquisition beyond the borders of structured learning while academic education in itself is structured and is usually given by Established and Certified Institutions of learning.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe internet is both the &ldquo;Diviner&rdquo; and the oracle of education.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDon&rsquo;t be surprised when the government starts certifying and accrediting E-Universities for Courses that were once only taught in &ldquo;Offline&rdquo; Schools. The internet is the sole future of Distance Learning, take that from me. In fact, it&rsquo;s not just the future, it&rsquo;s the past and present. Pardon my effrontery but it&rsquo;s a fact.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany who pursue oversea programs have found it unusually easy mainly because of the correspondence the internet gives. I know of many who reads and take lectures for their masters programs on the internet while they only travel over for the exams. There are even courses that allow for e-exams.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Non-Academic form of education cannot be downplayed as unimportant and un-factorable to the future possibilities of the internet. Don&rsquo;t be surprised if your wife tells you she learnt how to cook your favorite meal from the internet, don&rsquo;t be surprised if I tell you that Warren Buffet reads about Future Investment Forecast from the internet and don&rsquo;t be surprised if your friend tells you he received his miracle while listening to a sermon on YouTube.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is my own rather hypermetric view of the internet and I believe everyone needs to be informed about the greatness of this grandiose invention called the Internet.<br />\r\n&nbsp;', '2016-05-03 07:52:26', 'Education,Internet');
